Branches in Git
=====================
This is a feature of git using which we can create code
related to different functionalities on various branches
and then merge with the master/main branch
This helps in creating the code in an uncluttered
and organised way

1 To see the the list of local branches
  git branch

2 To see the list of all branches(local and remote)
  git branch -a

3 To create branch
  git branch branch_name

4 To move into a branch
  git checkout branch_name

5 To create a branch and also move into it
  git checkout -b branch_name

6 To merge a branch
  git merge branch_name

7 To delete a branch that is merged
  git branch -d branch_name
  This is also called as soft delete

8 To delete a branch that is not merged
  git branch -D branch_name
  This is called as Hard delete

===================================================================
Whenever a branch is created what ever is the commit
history of the parent branch wil be copied into the
new branch

Irrespective of where a file is created or modified git
only considers the branch from where the commit operation
is performed
