Multi Branch Pipeline
=========================
Generally developers create multiple branches and upload
code related to various functionalities on these branches
We have to configure Jenkins in such a way that it triggers
CI-CD process for all these branches parallelly.

To do this we need to have a copy of JEnkinsfile on each branch
and then based on the instructuions in the Jenkinsfile all
the stages have to be triggered

=======================================================================
Developers Activity
=========================
1 Clone the maven repository
  git clone https://github.com/AnupamaSoma/maven-project.git

2 Move into this cloned repository and delete .git folder
  cd maven
  rm -rf .git

3 Initilise a new git repository
  git init

4 Send the files into stagging area and local repository
  git add .
  git commit -m "a"

5 Create a jenkins file and put the stages of CI that should happen 
  on master  branch
  vim Jenkinsfile

6 Send it to stagging and local repository
  git add .
  git commit -m "b"

7 Create a new branch called loans and create  a new Jenkinsfile
  git checkout -b loans
  vim Jenkinsfile
  Use the CI instructions that should be done on Loans branch

8 Send this to stagging and local repoistory
  git add .
  git commit -m "c"

9 Open github.com---->Create a new repository

10 Push all the branches from local machine to remote github
   git push origin --all

Jenkins Admin Activity
==============================
1 Open the dashboard of Jenkins

2 Click on New item---->Enter item name as MultBranchPipeline

3 Select MultiBranchPipeline--->OK

4 Go to Branch Sounrces---->Select Git-->enter github url where developers
  uploaded the code

5 Go to Scan Multi branch pipeline triggers---->Select 1 minute

6 Apply--->Save
==================================================================

=======================================================================
Webhooks 
===========
This is  used to send notifications from github to jenkins
Whenever any code changes are done and that is checkdin into
github, webhook will send an immediate notifiction to JEnkins
and Jenkins will triggern the job

1 Open github.com---->Click on the reposiotry that we are working on
2 On the right corner clikc on Setting
3 Click on Webhooks in the left pannel
4 Click on Add Webhook
5 In Payload URL: http://public_ip_jenkinsserver:8080/github-webhook/
6 In Content type select :application/json
7 Click on Add Webhook
8 Open the dashboaard of Jenkins
9 Go to the job that we want to configure
10 Go to Build triggers
11 Check GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
12 Click on Apply--->Save
   Now if we make any changes to the code in github then github
  will send an notification to jenkins and jenkins will run that job
