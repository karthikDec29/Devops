git diff
------------
this is used for finding the difference between 2 commits
or it can be used for finding the difference between
a commit and a file yet to be commited


1 To find diff between 2 commits
  git diff commit1_id commit2_id

2 To find diff between latest commit and a file
  git diff HEAD filename

==================================================
Continuious Integration
=============================
Stage 1 (Continuous Downlaod)
==============================
Developers create some code and upload it into some version
controlling system like Git.Jenkins should immediately download
that code and this is called continuous download

Stage 2 Continuous Build
=============================
The code downloaded in the previous stage has to coverted into a
setup file commonly know as artifact.This artifcat can be in the format
of jar,war,ear file etc.To trigger this build process jenkins uses 
build tools like Maven,Grade,Msbuild etc.This stage is called continuous
build

Stage 3 (Continuous Deployment)
==================================
The artifact in the previous stage has to deployed into the testing
environment.This testing servers might be running on some application
servers like tomcat,Weblogic etc.Once it is deployed here it become
available to the testers.This is called continuous deployment

Stage 4 (Continuous Testing)
================================
Testers create automation test scripts uisng tools like Seleniumm,Codedui
etc.Jenkins now executes these automation testin scripts and check if the 
application is working correctly or no.If it not working jenkins will send
email notifications to the corresponding team members.Develeopers will
fix the defects and upload the modifed code into git,Jenkins will again
start from stage 1

Stage 5 (Continuous delivery)
=============================
If testing passes jenkins will deploy tha artifact into the production
servers form where the end user or client can start accessing it
This is called continuous delivery

Stage1-4 are called as CI (Continuous Integration)
Stage 5 is called as CD (Continuous Delivery)

3 Add the debain repository address to jenkins.list file
  sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > 
                                     /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

4 Update the apt repository
  sudo apt-get update

5 Install jenkins
  sudo apt-get install -y jenkins
