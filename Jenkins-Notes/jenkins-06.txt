MAster Slave Architecture of Jenkins
============================================
This is used distribute the work load to additional linux
servers called as slaves.This is used when we want to run multiple 
jobs on jenkins parallelly.

Setup
============
1 Create a new AWS ubuntu20 instance

2 Install the same version of java as present in the master
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk

3 Setup passwordless SSH betwen Master and slave
  a) Connect to slave and set password to default user
     sudo passwd ubuntu
  b) Edit the ssh config file
     sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     Search for "PasswordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
  c) Restart ssh
     sudo service ssh restart
  d) Connect to Master using git bash
  e) Generate the ssh keys
     ssh-keygen
  f) Copy the ssh keys
     ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private_ip_of_slave
     This will copy the content of the public keys to a file called
     "authorised_keys" on the slave machine


  Connect to slave using git bash
4 Downlaod the slave.jar file
  wget http://private_ip_of_jenkinsserver:8080/jnlpJars/slave.jar

5 Give execute permissions to the slave.jar
  chmod u+x slave.jar

6 Create an empty folder that will be the workspace of jenkins
  mkdir workspace

7 Open the dashboard of Jenkins
  
8 Click on Manage Jenkins--->Click on Manage Nodes and Clouds

9 Click on New node---->Enter some node name as Slave1

10 Select Permanant Agent--->OK

12 Enter remote root directory as /home/ubuntu/workspace

13 Labels: myslave (This label is associated with a job in jenkins
   and then that job will run on that slave)

14 Go to Launch Method and select "Launch agent via execution of command on master"
   ssh ubuntu@private_ip_of_slave java -jar slave.jar
15 Click on Save

16 Go to the dashboard of Jenkins

17 Go to the job that we want to run on slave---->Click on Configure

18 Go to General section

19 Check restrict where this project can be run

20 Enter slave label as myslave
