====================================================================
FailOver Scenarios of Workers
================================
Create httpd with 6 replicas and delete one replica running on the manager
Check if all 6 replicas are still running

Drain Worker1 from the docker swarm and check if all 6 replicas are running
on Manager and Worker2,make Worker1 rejoin the swarm

Make Worker2 leave the swarm and check if all the 6 replicas are
running on Manager and Worker1

1 Create httpd with 6 replicas
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 9090:80 --replicas 6 httpd

2 Check the replicas running on Manager
  docker service ps webserver | grep Manager

3 Check the container id
  docker container ls

4 Delete a replica
  docker rm -f container_id_from_step3

5 Check if all 6 replicas are running
  docker service ps webserver

6 Drain Worker1 from the swarm
  docker node update --availability drain Worker1

7 Check if all 6 replicas are still running on Manager and Worker2
  docker service ps webserver

8 Make Worker1 rejoin the swarm
  docker node update --availability active Worker1

9 Make Worker2 leave the swarm
  Connect to Worker2 using git bash
  docker swarm leave
  Connect to Manager
  
10 Check if all 6 replicas are still running
   docker service ps webserver


======================================================================
FailOver Scenarios of Managers
====================================
If a worker instance crashses all the replicas running on that
worker will be moved to the Manager or the other workers.
If the Manager itself crashes the swarm becomes headless 
ie we cannot perfrom container orchestration activites in this
swamr cluster

To avoid this we should maintain multiple managers
Manager nodes have the status as Leader or Reachable

If one manager node goes down other manager becomes the Leader
Quorum is resonsible for doing this activity and if uses a RAFT
algorithm for handling the failovers of managers.Quorum also 
is responsible for mainting the min number of manager

Min count of manager required for docker swarm should be always
more than half of the total count of Managers

Total Manager Count  -    Min Manager Required
      1              -           1
      2              -           2
      3              -           2
      4              -           3
      5              -           3
      6              -           4
      7              -           4




==================================================================================
Overlay Networking
=========================
This is the deafult network used by swarm
and this network perfrom network load balancin
ie even if a service is running on a specific worker we can
access if from orther slave

UseCase
=============
Start nginx with 2 repliacs and check if we can acces it from 
browser from manager and all workers

1 Create nginx
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 8888:80 --replicas 2 nginx

2 Check where these 2 replcas are running
  docker service ps webserver
  These repliacs will be running on only 2 nodes and we will have a third
  node where it it not running

3 Check if we can access nginx from the third node where it is not present
  public_ip_of_thirdnode:8888

=============================================================================
UseCase
===========
Create 2 overlay networks levelup1 and levelup2
Create httpd with 5 replacs on intelliqit1 network
Create tomcat with 5 replicas on default overlay "ingres" network
and later perform rolling network update to levelup2 network

1 Create 2 overlay networks
  docker network create  --driver overlay levelup1
  docker network create  --driver overlay levelup2

2 Check if 2 overlay networks are created
  docker network ls

3 Create httpd with 5 replcias on inteliiqit1 network
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 8888:80 --replicas 5 
                                           --network levelup1 httpd

4 To check if httpd is running on levelup1 network
  docker service inspect webserver
  This command will generate the output in JSON format
  To see the above output in normal text fromat
  docker service inspect webserver --pretty

5 Create tomcat with 5 replicas on the deafult ingres network
  docker service create --name appserver -p 9999:8080 --replicas 5 tomcat

6 Perform a rolling network update from ingres to levelup2 network
  docker service update --network-add levelup2 appserver

7 Check if tomcat is now running on levelup2 network
  docker service inspect appserver --pretty

Note: To remove from levelup2 network
      docker service update --network-rm levelup2 appserver

===============================================================================
Docker Stack
=====================
docker compose + docker swarm = docker stack
docker compose + kubernetes = kompose

Docker compose when implemented at the level of docker swarm
it is called docker stack.Using docker stack we can create an orchestreta
a micro services architecture at the level of production servers

1 To create a stack from a compose file
  docker stack deploy -c compose_filename stack_name

2 To see the list of stacks created
  docker stack ls

3 To see on which nodes the stack services are running
  docker stack ps stack_name

4 To delete a stack
  docker stack rm stack_name

=====================================================================
UseCase
================
Create a docker stack file to start 3 replicas of wordpress
and one replica of mysql

vim stack1.yml
---
version: '3.8'

services:
 db:
  image: "mysql:5"
  environment:
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password

 wordpress:
  image: wordpress
  ports:
   - "8989:80"
  deploy:
   replicas: 3

To start the stack file
docker stack deploy -c stack1.yml mywordpress

To see the services running
docker service ls

To check where the serives are running
docker stack ps mywordpress

To delete the stack
docker stack rm mywordpress


================================================================================
UseCase
==============
Create a stack file to setup CI-cd architecture where a jenkins
container is linked with tomcats for qa and prod environments
The jenkins contianers should run only on Manager
the qaserver tomcat should run only on Worker1 and prodserver
tomcat should run only on worker2

vim stack2.yml
---
version: '3.8'

services:
 myjenkins:
  image: jenkins/jenkins
  ports:
   - 5050:8080
  deploy:
   replicas: 2
   placement:
    constraints:
     - node.hostname == Manager

 qaserver:
  image: tomcat
  ports:
   - 6060:8080
  deploy:
   replicas: 3
   placement:
    constraints:
     - node.hostname == Worker1

 prodserver:
  image: tomcat
  ports:
   - 7070:8080
  deploy:
   replicas: 4
   placement:
    constraints:
     - node.hostname == Worker2
...

To start the services 
docker deploy -c stack2.yml ci-cd

To check the replicas 
docker stack ps ci-cd

===================================================================
Docker secrets
===========================
This is a feature of docker swarm using which we can pass secret data
to the services running in swarm cluster
These secrets are created on the host machine and they will be
availbale from all the replicas in the swarm cluster

1 Create a dcoker secret
  echo "Hello" | docker secret create mysecret -

2 Create a redis db with 5 replace and mount the secret
  docker service create --name myredis --replicas 5 --secret mysecret redis

3 Capture one of the replica contianer id
  docker container ls

4 Check if the secret data is available
  docker exec -it container_id cat /run/secrets/mysecret


==============================================================================
Create 3 secrets for postgres user,password and db
and pass them to the stack file

1 Create secrets
  echo "password" | docker secret create pg_password -
  echo "myuser" | docker secret create pg_user -
  echo "mydb" | docker secret create pg_db -

2 Check if the secrets are created
  docker secret ls

3 Create the docker stack file to work on these secrets
  vim stack6.yml
---
version: '3.1'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/pg_password
      POSTGRES_USER_FILE: /run/secrets/pg_user
      POSTGRES_DB_FILE: /run/secrets/pg_db
    secrets:
     - pg_password
     - pg_user
     - pg_db

  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    deploy:
     replicas: 2

secrets:
    pg_password:
     external: true
    pg_user:
     external: true
    pg_db:
     external: true
