Handlers
================
1 Handlers are modules that are executed if some other module 
  is executed successfully and it has made some changes

2 Handlers are executed only after all the tasks are executed

3 Handlers are executed in the order that they are mentioned 
  in the handlers section and not in the order that they are
  called in the tasks section

4 Even if a handler is called multiple times in the task section
  it will be executed only once

vim playbook17.yml

- name: Implementing Handlers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install apache2
     apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
     notify: Check url response
   - name: Edit the index.html file
     copy:
      content: "IntelliQIT Home Page"
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
     notify: Restart apache2
  handlers:

Error Handling or Exception Handling
========================================
If we want the ansbile playbook to continue its execution
even if a specific module fails then we can use Error Handling

The section of code that might fail is given in the "block" section
If it fails the control goes to the "rescue" section,"always"
section is executed everytime
