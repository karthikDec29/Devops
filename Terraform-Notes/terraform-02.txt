groups of maintainers, or other members of the Terraform community.

=================================================================
Multiple Providers:

Terraform supports multiple providers to create a configuration.

resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
   prefix = "Mr"
   separator = "."
    length = "1"
}

We can add above random_pet creation resource to our terraform configuration file.

====================================================================
Input variables:

Each input variable must be declared using a variable block:


main.tf:

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = var.ami
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name   = "LevelupDevops"
  tags = var.tags
}


variables.tf

variable "ami" {
 type = string
 default  = "ami-04505e74c0741db8d"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  type = string
    default = "t2.micro"
}
variable "key" {
 type = string
 default = "LevelupDevops"
}
variable "tags" {
 type = map
  default = {
   "Name" =  "Helloworld",
   "createdby" = "terraform",
    "demo"    = "variable"
   }
}
