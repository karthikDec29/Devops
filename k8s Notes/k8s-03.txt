Kubernetes Architecture
=============================
Master Componentes
=======================
Container runtime: This can be docker or anyother container technology

apiServer: Users interact with the apiServer using some clinet like ui,command line tool like kubelet.It is the apiServer which is the gateway to the cluster
It works as a gatekeeper  for authentication and it validates if a specific
user is having permissions to execute a specific command.Example if we want to
deploy a pod or a deployment first apiServers validates if the user is authorised to perform that action and if so it passes to the next process
ie the "Scheduler"

Scheduler: This process accepts the instructions from apiServer after validation
and starts an application on a sepcific node or set of nodes.It estimates
how much amount of h/w is required for an application and then checks which
slave have the necessary h/w resources and instructs the kubelet to deploy
the application

kubelet: This is the actual process that takes the orders from scheduler and
deploy an application on a slave.This kubelet is present on both master and slave

controller manager: This check if the desired state of the cluster is always
maintained.If a pod dies it recreates that pod to maintain the desired state

etcd: Here the cluster state is maintained in key value pairs.
It maintains info about the slaves and the h/w resources available on
the slaves and also the pods running on the slaves
The scheduler and the control manager read the info from this etcd
and schedule the pods and maintain the desired state

===========================================================================
Worker components
======================= 
containerrun time: Docker or some other container technology

kubelet: This process interacts with container run time and the node 
and it start a pod with a container in it

kubeproxy: This will take the request from services to pod
It has the intellegence to forward a request to
a near by pod.Eg If an application pod wants to communicate with a db pod
then kubeproxy will take that request to the nearby pod 

===========================================================================
UseCase
===========
Create nginx as a pod and name it webserver
kubectl run --image nginx webserver

To see the list of pods running
kubectl get pods

To see more info about the pods like their ip and slave where they are running
kubectl  get pods -o wide

To delete the pod
kubectl delete pods webserver

============================================================================
UseCase
========= 
Create mysql pod and name it mydb and go into its interactive terminal and create few tables

kubectl run --image mysql:5 mydb --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=intelliqit

To check the pods
kubectl get pods

To go into the interactive terminal
kubectl exec -it mydb -- bash

To login into the db
mysql -u root -p
Password: intellqiit

Create tables here

=========================================================================
Kuberentes Defintion files
==============================
Objects in Kubernetes cluster are deployed using these
defintion files 
They are created using yml and they generally these 4 top level 
fields.

apiVersion:


kind:
metadata:
spec:

apiVersion : This specifies the code library that has to be imported
to create a particualr kind of Kubernetes object

kind: Here we specify the type kubernetes object that we want to 
create(Pod,ReplicaSet,Deployment,Service etc)

metadata: Here we can give additional info about the Pod like
the name of the Pod,some labels etc

spec: This is where exact info about the object that is created is
specified like containers info port mapping,no of replicas etc

================================================================
kind                     apiVersions
===================================================
Pod			 v1
Service			 v1
Secret			 v1
Namespace		 v1
ReplicationController    v1
Volume		         v1
ReplicaSet  		 apps/v1
Deployment	         apps/v1
StatefuleSet             apps/v1


==================================================================
Create a pod defintion file to start nginx pod with a name webserver

1 vim pod-defintion1.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
 labels:
  type: proxy
  author: levelup
spec:
 containers:
  - name: webserver
    image: nginx
   
...

2 Create pod from the above file
  kubectl apply -f pod-defintion1.yml

3 To check the list of pods
  kubectl get pods

4 To delete the pods
  kubectl delete -f pod-defintion1.yml

========================================================================
UseCase
================
Create a postgres-pod and give the labels as author=intelliqit
and type=db,also pass the necessay environment variables

1 vim pod-definition2.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: postgres-pod
 labels:
  author: levelup
  type: db
spec:
 containers:
  - name: mydb
    image: postgres
    env:
     - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
       value: levelup
     - name: POSTGRES_USER
       value: myuser
     - name: POSTGRES_DB
       value: mydb
...

To create pods from the above file
kubectl apply -f pod-defintion2.yml


====================================================================
UseCase
============
Create a jenkins-pod and also perfrom necessary port mapping

vim pod-definition2.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: jenkins-pod
 labels:
  type: ci-cd
  author: levelup
spec:
 containers:
  - name: jenkins
    image: jenkins/jenkins
    ports:
     - containerPort: 8080
       hostPort: 8080
...

To create the pods from the above file
kubectl apply -f pod-defintion3.yml

To check if the jnekins pod is running
kubectl get pods -o wide

To accesss jenkins from browser
kubectl get nodes -o wide
Capture the external ip of the node where jenkins pod is running
in browser
externalip:8080
