Kubernetes
======================

Menions: This is an individual node used in kubernetes
Combination of these minions is called as Kubernetes cluster

Master is the main machine which triggers the container orchestraion
It distributes the work load to the Slaves

Slaves are the nodes that accept the work load from the master
and handle activites load balancing,autoscalling,high availability etc



Kubernetes uses various of types of Object

1 Pod: This is a layer of abstraction on top of a container.This is the samallest
  object that kubernetes can work on.In the Pod we have a container.
  The advantage of using a Pod is that kubectl commands will work on the Pod and the 
  Pod communicates these instructions to the container.In this way we can use the
  same  kubectl irresepective of which technology containers are in the Pod.



2 Service: This is used for port mapping and network load balancing

3 NameSpace: This is used for creating partitions in the cluster.Pods running
 in a namespace cannot communicate with other pods running in other namespace

4 Secrets: This is used for passing encrypted data to the Pods

5 ReplicationController: This is used for managing multiple replicas of PODs
and also perfroming saclling 

6 ReplicaSet: This is similar to replicationcontroller but it is more advanced
where features like selector can be implemented

7 Deployment: This used for perfroming all activites that a Replicaset can do
  it can also handle rolling update

8 Volume: Used to preserve the data even when the pods are deleted

9 Statefulsets: These are used to handle stateful application like data bases
  where consistency in read write operations has to be maintained.

10 Ingress: This object is used for mapping ip with domain name
